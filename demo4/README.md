# **SCCs Strategies**

In this demo we will learn how we can work with the different strategies for our workloads.

SELinuxContext
MustRunAs - Requires seLinuxOptions to be configured if not using pre-allocated values. Uses seLinuxOptions as the default. Validates against seLinuxOptions.

RunAsAny - No default provided. Allows any seLinuxOptions to be specified.



## **Hands-on Demo 1**

In this demo we will see a few `RunAsUser` strategies we can configure.

**MustRunAsRange Strategy**

1. Create a namespace for running the demo:

    ~~~sh
    NAMESPACE="scc-strategies"
    oc create ns ${NAMESPACE}
    ~~~
2. Create a user and give it edit role on the namespace:

    ~~~sh
    oc -n ${NAMESPACE} create sa testuser
    oc -n ${NAMESPACE} adm policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:${NAMESPACE}:testuser
    ~~~
3. We are going to create our own SCC based on the restricted one:
        
    > **NOTE**: We removed `system:authenticated` group so we will need to assign the SCC manually to our SAs/Users/Groups. On top of that we added `priority: 1` so it has more priority than `restricted` SCC when they both are elegible.

    ~~~sh
    cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
    kind: SecurityContextConstraints
    metadata:
      name: restricted-runasuser
    priority: 1
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
    requiredDropCapabilities:
    - KILL
    - MKNOD
    - SETUID
    - SETGID
    runAsUser:
      type: MustRunAsRange
    seLinuxContext:
      type: MustRunAs
    supplementalGroups:
      type: RunAsAny
    users: []
    volumes:
    - configMap
    - downwardAPI
    - emptyDir
    - persistentVolumeClaim
    - projected
    - secret
    allowHostDirVolumePlugin: false
    allowHostIPC: false
    allowHostNetwork: false
    allowHostPID: false
    allowHostPorts: false
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
    allowPrivilegedContainer: false
    allowedCapabilities: null
    apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
    defaultAddCapabilities: null
    fsGroup:
      type: MustRunAs
    groups: []
    EOF
    ~~~
4. We're grating use privileges of this new SCC to the SA test-user:

    ~~~sh
    oc -n ${NAMESPACE} adm policy add-scc-to-user restricted-runasuser system:serviceaccount:${NAMESPACE}:testuser
    ~~~
5. Our SCC has the following configuration:

    ~~~yaml
    runAsUser:
      type: MustRunAsRange
    ~~~
6. Since we're not defining a range, the availabe UID range for pods to use will be determined by the range assigned to the namespace:

    ~~~sh
    oc get ns ${NAMESPACE} -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.openshift\.io\/sa\.scc\.uid-range}'
    ~~~

    > **NOTE**: The output indicates that the first UID available in our range is the `1000650000` and we have `+10000` UIDs after that first one.

    ~~~
    1000650000/10000
    ~~~
7. Let's create a deployment without explicitly telling it what UID to use:

    ~~~sh
    cat <<EOF | oc -n ${NAMESPACE} create --as=system:serviceaccount:${NAMESPACE}:testuser -f -
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: reversewords-app
      name: reversewords-app
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: reversewords-app
      strategy: {}
      template:
        metadata:
          creationTimestamp: null
          labels:
            app: reversewords-app
        spec:
          serviceAccountName: testuser
          containers:
          - image: quay.io/mavazque/reversewords:ubi8
            name: reversewords
            resources: {}
    status: {}
    EOF
    ~~~
8. We can see how the pod is running with the UID `1000650000`:

    ~~~sh
    oc -n ${NAMESPACE} exec -ti deployment/reversewords-app -- whoami
    ~~~

    ~~~
    1000650000
    ~~~
9. We can now patch the deployment so we explicitly request a UID from the range:

    ~~~sh
    oc -n ${NAMESPACE} patch deployment reversewords-app -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"$setElementOrder/containers":[{"name":"reversewords"}],"containers":[{"name":"reversewords","securityContext":{"runAsUser":1000650015}}]}}}}'
    ~~~
10. Now the pod will be running with the requested UID `1000650015`:

    ~~~sh
    oc -n ${NAMESPACE} exec -ti deployment/reversewords-app -- whoami
    ~~~

    ~~~
    1000650015
    ~~~
11. If we try to use a random nonroot UID outside the allowed range this is what happens:

    ~~~sh
    oc -n ${NAMESPACE} patch deployment reversewords-app -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"$setElementOrder/containers":[{"name":"reversewords"}],"containers":[{"name":"reversewords","securityContext":{"runAsUser":5000}}]}}}}'
    ~~~

    ~~~sh
    oc -n ${NAMESPACE} get deployment reversewords-app -o yaml | grep -A50 ^status:
    ~~~

    > The deployment cannot create the pod because the request UID `5000` is not within the allowed range.
    ~~~
    status:
    <OUTPUT_OMITTED>
      - lastTransitionTime: "2021-02-11T18:08:50Z"
        lastUpdateTime: "2021-02-11T18:08:50Z"
        message: 'pods "reversewords-app-79d8dbf889-" is forbidden: unable to validate against any security context constraint: [spec.containers[0].securityContext.runAsUser: Invalid value: 5000: must be in the ranges: [1000650000, 1000659999] spec.containers[0].securityContext.runAsUser: Invalid value: 5000: must be in the ranges: [1000650000, 1000659999]]'
        reason: FailedCreate
        status: "True"
        type: ReplicaFailure
    <OUTPUT_OMITTED>
    ~~~
12. If we want to provide our own valid range, we can edit the SCC in order to allow the range we choose:

    > **NOTE**: Below command patches our SCC to allow UIDs for our pods between 2000 and 2500.

    ~~~sh
    oc patch scc restricted-runasuser -p '{"runAsUser":{"uidRangeMax":2500,"uidRangeMin":2000}}' --type merge
    ~~~
13. If we patch the deployment again to remove the `runAsUser` the pod will get the first UID available in the new range:

    ~~~sh
    oc -n ${NAMESPACE} patch deployment reversewords-app -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"$setElementOrder/containers":[{"name":"reversewords"}],"containers":[{"name":"reversewords","securityContext":null}]}}}}'
    ~~~

    ~~~sh
    oc -n ${NAMESPACE} exec -ti deployment/reversewords-app -- whoami
    ~~~

    ~~~
    2000
    ~~~
14. On top of the new range, we can continue using the range provided by the namespace.

**MustRunAs Strategy**

1. We can also force all our pods to run with a specific uid, let's patch our SCC first:

    ~~~sh
    oc patch scc restricted-runasuser -p '{"runAsUser":{"type":"MustRunAs","uid":1024,"uidRangeMax":null,"uidRangeMin":null}}' --type merge
    ~~~

2. Let's force a recreation of the pod:

    ~~~sh
    oc -n ${NAMESPACE} delete pod -l app=reversewords-app
    ~~~

3. If we check the UID now, we will see that it's the one we forced `1024`:

    ~~~sh
    oc -n ${NAMESPACE} exec -ti deployment/reversewords-app -- whoami
    ~~~

    ~~~
    1024
    ~~~
4. If we try to patch the deployment to make it run with a different UID, it won't work.

**RunAsAny and MustRunAsNonRoot Strategies**

These two strategies can be used as well. `RunAsAny` allows our pods to run with any UID, including `UID 0`, whereas `MustRunAsNonRoot` allows our pods to run with any UID, but `UID 0`.

These strategies do not provide default values.

**runAsGroup**

By default (unless you specify runAsGroup) the user running the container is always a member of the root group (GID 0), which doesn't grant any privileges but allows the user to read/write files accessible by GID 0. That's required for some apps that need to read config files owned by root. We can think of an example nginx pod which has its configuration files owned by root with '0640' permission. The nginx process could be run with a random UID (which cannot read the root owned files), but since the user is a member of the root group it will be able to read the config files and run nginx properly.

## **Hands-on Demo 2**

In this demo we will see how we can use `SELinuxContext` strategies:

SELinuxContext: Controls which SELinux context is used by the containers.

## **Hands-on Demo 3**

In this demo we will se how we can use `FSGroup` and `SupplementalGroups` strategies for accesing storage from our pods.

Both strategies have the same config modes we already saw for `RunAsUser`, so instead of focusing on how the different config modes affect the user that runs the pod, we will focus on what are the differences between using `FSGroup` and `SupplementalGroups` and how they impact the storage mounted on the pod.


**FSGroup**

As you might know, `FSGroup` is mainly used for block storage because it will chown the content of the storage so the group id defined can read/write content. As you can imagine, running such operation in a shared storage is not a good idea.

We can still decide if the content is chowned using the `FSGroupChangePolicy`, but still, there are storage plugins like nfs that won't take into account `FSGroup` strategies.

In this demo we will mount a pv inside a pod and we will see how the different configurations for `FSGroup` affect to the files created on the storage.

1. First, we need a storage class to dynamically bind volumes to pods.

    ~~~sh
    cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
      name: local-storage
    provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
    volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
    EOF
    ~~~
2. We are going to create a `local` `PersistentVolume` which will give us access to a folder inside the `worker` nodes:

    ~~~sh
    cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
      name: test-volume
    spec:
      capacity:
        storage: 5Gi
      volumeMode: Filesystem
      accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
      persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
      storageClassName: local-storage
      local:
        path: /var/tmp
      nodeAffinity:
        required:
          nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
            - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
              operator: In
              values:
              - ""
    EOF
    ~~~
3. Finally, we create the `PersistentVolumeClaim`:

    ~~~sh
    cat <<EOF | oc -n ${NAMESPACE} create -f -
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: test-volume-claim
    spec:
      storageClassName: local-storage
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 5Gi
    EOF
    ~~~
4. Before creating our deployment, we are going to tune the SCC we have been using in the first hands on lab. This time we will configure a GID range for the `FSGroup`, that way our containers will need to use that range for mounting the storage.

    > **NOTE**: Below patch will allow pods using our SCC to use GIDs between 5000 and 6000. If no `FSGroup` is set in the `securityContext` configuration, it will get the first GID from the range, `5000` in this case.

    ~~~sh
    oc patch scc restricted-runasuser -p '{"fsGroup":{"ranges":[{"max":6000,"min":5000}]}}' --type merge
    ~~~
5. Now, it's time to create the deployment, we will use `FSGroup` 5005:
    
    ~~~sh
    cat <<EOF | oc -n ${NAMESPACE} create --as=system:serviceaccount:${NAMESPACE}:testuser -f -
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: reversewords-app-storage
      name: reversewords-app-storage
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: reversewords-app-storage
      strategy: {}
      template:
        metadata:
          creationTimestamp: null
          labels:
            app: reversewords-app-storage
        spec:
          securityContext:
            fsGroup: 5005
          volumes:
          - name: test-volume
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: test-volume-claim
          serviceAccountName: testuser
          containers:
          - image: quay.io/mavazque/reversewords:ubi8
            name: reversewords
            resources: {}
            volumeMounts:
              - name: test-volume
                mountPath: "/mnt"
    status: {}
    EOF
    ~~~

fsGroup:
  ranges:
  - max: 6000
    min: 5000
  type: MustRunAs
